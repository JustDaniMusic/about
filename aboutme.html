					Hi! I'm Dani.<br>
					You may know me as Just Dani, DJ, Producer and Video Editor or <br>
					"IS THAT THE GUY THAT FIXES ARCADES AT BLAST-GALAXY!?" <br>
					Either way, you're not wrong. Because I actually do both! :D <br>
					I have two main hobbys. <br>
					One is being creative with music and video, A.K.A Music Production and Video Editor. <br>
					And the other one is fixing all kinds of technical problems. <br>
					This could be software, but also hardware. <br>
					For my Music Producer work, you can visit my

			I know a lot that has to do with Konami and Sega's japanese hard- and software. <br>
			And that's why I came into place in order to get all the Japanese Games Running <br>
			and online in order to get Software Updates, save date and more features working. <br>
			If you live near Amsterdam, or you have the ability to go there, <br>
			I would deffinitely recommend check us out! <br>
			<br>
			In the weekends, I always go to Blast Galaxy to do some improvements in my Rhythm Games. <br>
			Games like Wacca, Chunithm, MaiMai and SDVX really gather my attention to improve my scores. <br>
			I almost have a rating of 2000 in Wacca, and I hope to improve them on the other games soon! <br>
			And everything is powered by Blast-Galaxy!!
			<br>
			Well, That's it for now! Hope to see you know more about me now. <br>
			Hope to meet you soon! <br>
